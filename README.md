The Energy Distribution System is a multi-paradigm software which controls the distribution of energy from multiple sources, including Hydro, Solar and Wind. To guarantee a steady supply, it prioritises distribution, assesses energy output and demand, and stores excess energy. The system's functionality, features, usage, and potential future enhancements are all included and concluded in this README.

Using both procedural and object-orientated progamming examples, this project replicates an energy distribution system and supports the following features:
- Manage energy sources (Hydro, Wind and Solar) effificently.
- Determine and distribute energy based on current supply and demand.
- Store extra inventory when supply is plentiful and demand is low.
- Allow energy sources to be added and removed dynamically.

Among its attributes are:
- Management of energy production: collect and initialise energy data from various sources.
- Real-time demand matching distributed energy based on priority demands by continuously matching energy production to demand.
- Energy storage: excess energy is stored for later use when output surpasses demand.
- Users can add and remove energy sources as needed due to the dynamic source management.

Its applications include:
- Energy source initialisation: the system will request that production be entered for Hydro, Wind and Solar sources.
- Track the distributed in real-time: the system determines the overall amount of energy produced, compares it to the demand, and then distributes it in order of priority.
- Add/remove sources: as needed, dynamically add or remove energy sources by following the prompts.
- Real-time insights into energy distribution, demand matching, and stored energy are provided by display statistics, which are continuous data.

Upcoming enhancements:
- AI-based demand prediction: this method predicts future energy demand using Machine Learning and adjusts production accordingly.
- Real-time visualisation: observe production, demand and distribution trends using graphical tools.
- Increase the number of non-renewable energy sources like coal, and renewable energy sources like bioenergy.
